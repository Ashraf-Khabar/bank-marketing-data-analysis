# Bank Marketing Data Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing bank marketing data using PyTorch, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to a bank's term deposit.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to perform data analysis on a bank marketing dataset and develop a predictive model using PyTorch and scikit-learn. The project involves various stages, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:`

git clone <https://github.com/your-username/bank-marketing-data-analysis.git>

mathematicaCopy code

 `2. Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Run the following command in your terminal:`

pip install -r requirements.txt

markdownCopy code

 ## Usage

`1. Navigate to the project directory:`

cd bank-marketing-data-analysis

cssCopy code

 `2. Run the main analysis script:`

python main.py

markdownCopy code

 `This will execute the data analysis pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.`

## Dataset

The bank marketing dataset used in this project is available in the `data` directory. It contains information about various features such as age, job, marital status, education, etc., of individuals who were contacted for a marketing campaign. The target variable is whether the individual subscribed to a term deposit or not.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the bank marketing dataset (`bank.csv`).
- `models/`: Contains the PyTorch model implementation (`model.py`).
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation.
- `main.py`: The main script that executes the data analysis pipeline.

## Results

After running the analysis script, the project will generate various outputs, including:

- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)
- Visualizations of data insights and model evaluation results

These results will be displayed in the console and saved in the `results/` directory.
